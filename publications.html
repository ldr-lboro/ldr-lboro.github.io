Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) correspondences
form foundational frameworks of tasks such
as text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis or automatic
speech recognition. The G2P process involves
taking words in their written form and generating their pronunciation. In this paper, we
critique the status quo definition of a grapheme,
currently a forced alignment process relating
a single character to either a phoneme or a
blank unit, that underlies the majority of modern approaches. We develop a linguisticallymotivated redefinition from simple concepts
such as vowel and consonant count and word
length and offer a proof-of-concept implementation based on a multi-binary neural classification task. Our model achieves competitive
results with a 31.86% Word Error Rate on a
standard benchmark, while generating linguistically meaningful grapheme segmentations.

In the realm of social media discourse, the
integration of slang enriches communication,
reflecting the sociocultural identities of users.
This study investigates the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to paraphrase slang
within climate-related tweets from Nigeria and
the UK, with a focus on identifying emotional
nuances. Using DistilRoBERTa as the baseline model, we observe its limited comprehension of slang. To improve cross-cultural understanding, we gauge the effectiveness of leading LLMs: ChatGPT 4, Gemini, and LLaMA3
in slang paraphrasing. While ChatGPT 4 and
Gemini demonstrate comparable effectiveness
in slang paraphrasing, LLaMA3 shows less coverage, with all LLMs exhibiting limitations in
coverage, especially of Nigerian slang. Our
findings underscore the necessity for culturally-sensitive LLM development in emotion classification, particularly in non-anglocentric regions.

Manufacturers have increasingly turned to Artificial Intelligence (AI) to address specific problems in factories e.g. predictive maintenance, improving product quality etc. Implementing these in silos can miss critical interdependencies during root cause analysis and the interplay between various data sources across broader manufacturing operations. We provide a perspective on a holistic data model that harmonises data generated during production processes and across the supply chain enabling data-driven decisions to drive productivity, optimisation, and sustainability. Our approach is based on Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) that focuses on predictive maintenance to increase availability, Continued Process Verification (CPV) and predictive stability to improve quality, and real-time insights, thereby optimising performance. The proposed multimodal model can help enhance productivity and reduce waste and rework, lending itself to sustainability imperatives. Similarly, Cost to Serve analysis, which targets inefficiencies in the distribution network and transportation, helps facilitate a reduction in costs and minimisation of carbon footprint in the supply chain.

It has been forecasted that a quarter of the world’s energy usage will be
supplied from Offshore Wind (OSW) by 2050 (Smith 2023). Given that up to one
third of Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) arises from Operations and Maintenance
(O&M), the motive for cost reduction is enormous. In typical OSW farms hundreds
of alarms occur within a single day, making manual O&M planning without automated systems costly and difficult. Increased pressure to ensure safety and high
reliability in progressively harsher environments motivates the exploration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) systems as aids to the task. We
recently introduced a specialised conversational agent trained to interpret alarm
sequences from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and recommend comprehensible repair actions (Walker et al. 2023). Building on recent advancements on Large Language Models (LLMs), we expand on this earlier work,
fine tuning LLAMA (Touvron 2018), using available maintenance records from
EDF Energy. An issue presented by LLMs is the risk of responses containing unsafe
actions, or irrelevant hallucinated procedures. This paper proposes a novel framework for safety monitoring of OSW, combining previous work with additional safety
layers. Generated responses of this agent are being filtered to prevent raw responses endangering personnel and the environment. The algorithm represents
such responses in embedding space to quantify dissimilarity to pre-defined unsafe
concepts using the Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF). A second
layer identifies hallucination in responses by exploiting probability distributions to
analyse against stochastically generated sentences. Combining these layers, the approach finetunes individual safety thresholds based on categorised concepts,
providing a unique safety filter. The proposed framework has potential to utilise the
O&M planning for OSW farms using state-of-the-art LLMs as well as equipping
them with safety monitoring that can increase technology acceptance within the
industry.

Studies in digital conservation have increasingly used social media in recent years as a source of data to understand the
interactions between humans and nature, model and monitor biodiversity, and analyse online discourse about the conservation
of species. Current approaches to digital conservation are for the most part purely frequentist, i.e. focused on easily trackable
and quantiiable features, or purely qualitative, which allows a deeper level of interpretation, but is less scalable. Our approach
aims to evaluate the applicability of recent advances in deep learning in combination with semi-automatic analysis. We present
a multimodal neural learning framework that experiments with diferent combinations of linguistic and visual features and
metadata of tweets to predict user engagement from a function of likes and retweets. Experimental results show that text is the
single most efective modality for prediction when a large amount of training data is available. For smaller datasets, drawing
information from multiple modalities can boost performance. Notably, we ind a negative efect of large pre-trained language
models when dealing with substantially unbalanced datasets. A qualitative analysis into the triggers of user engagement
with tweets reveals that it emerges from a combination of online discourse topic and sentiment, and is often ampliied by
user activity, e.g. when content originates from an inluencer account. We ind clear evidence of existing sub-communities
around speciic topics, including animal photography and sightings, illegal wildlife trade and trophy hunting, deforestation and
destruction of nature and climate change and action in a broader sense.

 Digital Twin (DT) technology has seen an explosion in popularity, with wind energy no exception. This is particularly true for Operations & Maintenance (O&M) applications. However, this expanded use has been accompanied by loose, conflicting, definitions that threaten to reduce the term to a buzzword and prevent the technology from meeting its full potential. A number of attempts have been made to better define and classify DTs, however, these either oversimplify the term or tighten criteria, leading to the exclusion of many DT applications. A new definition framework dubbed the Digital Twin Family Tree is therefore proposed. This widens "Digital Twin" to a general umbrella term for the technology, accompanied by specific definitions. DT Tags are also used to provide individualised characteristics for implementations. A sector-specific definition was devised for component and system monitoring and predictions in wind energy O&M dubbed a CS-DT and suitable DT Tags created. The proposed framework was used to review existing research in literature, demonstrating the potential for increased understanding, explainability, and accessibility of DTs for expert and non-expert stakeholders.

This paper outlines our multimodal ensemble learning system for identifying persuasion tech- niques in memes. We contribute an approach which utilises the novel inclusion of consistent named visual entities extracted using Google Vision API’s as an external knowledge source, joined to our multimodal ensemble via late fu- sion. As well as detailing our experiments in ensemble combinations, fusion methods and data augmentation, we explore the impact of including external data and summarise post- evaluation improvements to our architecture based on analysis of the task results.

When training models for visual anomaly detection, typically, a dataset is collected and then annotated offline. Even if collecting raw data is relatively cheap, annotations are expensive, especially if they require human expertise. We therefore propose a novel interactive learning framework that combines active learning with natural language interaction to minimise the amount of annotated training data and allow for refined human expert feedback that may be leveraged in the learning pro- cess. In our initial experiments on wind turbine drone images, we demonstrate the effectiveness of active learning for anomaly detection when using ground truth la- bels, and assess the impact on learning when collecting labels from ‘experts’ versus ‘non-experts’ using our dialogue system. In addition to anomaly labels with confi- dence scores, we collect and analyse natural language explanations, which may be used to improve both anomaly detection performance and explainability.

Traditional predictive simulations and remote sensing techniques for forecasting floods are based on
fixed and spatially restricted physics-based models.
These models are computationally expensive and
can take many hours to run, resulting in predictions made based on outdated data. They are also
spatially fixed, and unable to scale to unknown
areas. By modelling the task as an image segmentation problem, an alternative approach using artificial intelligence to approximate the parameters
of a physics-based model in 2D is demonstrated,
enabling rapid predictions to be made in real-time.

To understand the global trends of human opinion on climate change in specific geographical areas, this research proposes a framework to analyse linguistic features and cultural differences in climate-related tweets. Our study combines transformer networks with linguistic feature analysis to address small dataset limitations and gain insights into cultural differences in tweets from the UK and Nigeria. Our study found that Nigerians use more leadership language and informal words in discussing climate change on Twitter compared to the UK, as these topics are treated as an issue of salience and urgency. In contrast, the UK’s discourse about climate change on Twitter is characterised by using more formal, logical, and longer words per sentence compared to Nigeria. Also, we confirm the geographical identifiability of tweets through a classification task using DistilBERT, which achieves 83% of accuracy.

Wind power is a key pillar in efforts to decarbonise energy production. However, variability in wind speed and resultant wind turbine power generation poses a challenge for power grid integration. Digital Twin (DT) technology provides intelligent service systems, combining real-time monitoring, predictive capabilities and communication technologies. Current DT research for wind turbine power generation has focused on providing wind speed and power generation predictions reliant on Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) sensors, with predictions often limited to the timeframe of datasets. This research looks to expand on this, utilising a novel framework for an intelligent DT system powered by k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) regression models to upscale live wind speed forecasts to higher wind turbine hub-height and then forecast power generation. As there is no live link to a wind turbine, the framework is referred to as a “Simulated Digital Twin” (SimTwin). 2019-2020 SCADA and wind speed data are used to evaluate this, demonstrating that the method provides suitable predictions. Furthermore, full deployment of the SimTwin framework is demonstrated using live wind speed forecasts. This may prove useful for operators by reducing reliance on SCADA systems and provides a research and development tool where live data is limited.

Traditional approaches to flood modelling mostly rely on hydrodynamic physical simulations. While these simulations can be accurate, they are computationally expensive and prohibitively so when thinking about real-time prediction based on dynamic environmental conditions. 
Alternatively, social media platforms such as Twitter are often used by people to communicate during a flooding event, but discovering which tweets hold useful information is the key challenge in extracting information from posts in real time. 
In this article, we present a novel model for flood forecasting and monitoring that makes use of a transformer network that assesses the severity of a flooding situation based on sentiment analysis of the multimodal inputs (text and images). We also present an experimental comparison of a range of state-of-the-art deep learning methods for image processing and natural language processing. Finally, we demonstrate that information induced from tweets can be used effectively to visualise fine-grained geographical flood-related information dynamically and in real-time.

Wind energy’s ability to liberate the world from conventional sources of energy relies on lowering the significant costs associated with the maintenance of wind turbines. Since icing events on turbine rotor blades are a leading cause of operational failures, identifying icing in advance is critical. Some recent studies have utilized deep learning (DL) techniques to predict icing events with high accuracy by leveraging rotor blade images, but these studies only focus on specific wind parks and fail to generalize to unseen scenarios (e.g., new rotor blade designs). In this paper, we aim to facilitate ice prediction on the face of lack of ice images in new wind parks. We propose the utilization of synthetic data augmentation via a generative artificial intelligence technique—the neural style transfer algorithm to improve the generalization of existing ice prediction models. We also compare the proposed technique with the CycleGAN as a baseline. We show that training standalone DL models with augmented data that captures domain-invariant icing characteristics can help improve predictive performance across multiple wind parks. Through efficient identification of icing, this study can support preventive maintenance of wind energy sources by making them more reliable toward tackling climate change.

This paper proposes a multi-channel convolutional neural network(MC-CNN) for classifying memes and non-memes. Our architecture is 
trained and validated on a challenging dataset that includes non-meme formats with textual attributes, which are also 
circulated online but rarely accounted for in meme classification tasks.
Alongside a transfer learning base, two additional channels capture 
low-level and fundamental features of memes that make them unique from other images with text. We contribute an approach
which outperforms previous meme classifiers specifically in live data evaluation, and one that is better able to generalise ’in the
wild’. Our research aims to improve accurate collation of meme content to support continued research in meme content analysis,
 and meme-related sub-tasks such as harmful content detection.

With an increasing emphasis on driving down the costs of Operations and Maintenance (O&M) in the Offshore Wind (OSW) sector, comes the requirement to explore new methodology and applications of Deep Learning (DL) to the domain. Condition-based monitoring (CBM) has been at the forefront of recent research developing alarm-based systems and data-driven decision making. This paper provides a brief insight into the research being conducted in this area, with a specific focus on alarm sequence modelling and the associated challenges faced in its implementation. The paper proposes a novel idea to predict a set of relevant repair actions from an input sequence of alarm sequences, comparing Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (biLSTM) models. Achieving training accuracy results of up to 80.23%, and test accuracy results of up to 76.01% with biLSTM gives a strong indication to the potential benefits of the proposed approach that can be furthered in future research. The paper introduces a framework that integrates the proposed approach into O&M procedures and discusses the potential benefits which include the reduction of a confusing plethora of alarms, as well as unnecessary vessel transfers to the turbines for fault diagnosis and correction.

Intelligent question-answering (QA) systems have witnessed increased interest in recent years, particularly in their ability to facilitate information access, data interpretation or decision support. The wind energy sector is one of the most promising sources of renewable energy, yet turbines regularly suffer from failures and operational inconsistencies, leading to downtimes and significant maintenance costs. Addressing these issues requires rapid interpretation of complex and dynamic data patterns under time-critical conditions. In this article, we present a novel approach that leverages interactive, natural language-based decision support for operations & maintenance (O&M) of wind turbines. The proposed interactive QA system allows engineers to pose domain-specific questions in natural language, and provides answers (in natural language) based on the automated retrieval of information on turbine sub-components, their properties and interactions, from a bespoke domain-specific knowledge graph. As data for specific faults is often sparse, we propose the use of paraphrase generation as a way to augment the existing dataset. Our QA system leverages encoder-decoder models to generate Cypher queries to obtain domain-specific facts from the KG database in response to user-posed natural language questions. Experiments with an attention-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model and a transformer show that the transformer accurately predicts up to 89.75% of responses to input questions, outperforming the Seq2Seq model marginally by 0.76%, though being 9.46 times more computationally efficient. The proposed QA system can help support engineers and technicians during O&M to reduce turbine downtime and operational costs, thus improving the reliability of wind energy as a source of renewable energy.

A rise in ecological anomalous events will be observed due to climate change. One such event is the harmful algal bloom which occurs due to an increase in nutrients from anthropogenic activities and has economic and ecological effects. Algae thrive in warmer temperatures which will lead to an increase in the frequency of harmful algal blooms. To overcome this increasing frequency, early detection tools are essential. Deep learning and frequent monitoring have been used to detect this phenomenon with a focus on unimodal approaches. In this work, we propose using multiple sources of satellite and in-situ data for detecting algal blooms with a joint multimodal learning approach, focusing on the North Sea and the Irish Sea. This work will aid domain experts to monitor potential changes to the ecosystem done by human interference and to take action when necessary.

Several existing resources are available for sentiment analysis (SA) tasks that are used for learning sentiment specific
embedding (SSE) representations. These resources are either large, common-sense knowledge graphs (KG) that cover a limited
amount of polarities/emotions or they are smaller in size, such as lexicons, which require costly human annotation and cover
fine-grained emotions. Therefore using knowledge resources to learn SSE representations is either limited by the low coverage
of polarities/emotions or the overall size of a resource. In this paper, we first introduce a new directed KG called ‘RELATE’,
which is built to overcome both the issue of low coverage of emotions and the issue of scalability. RELATE is the first KG of
its size to cover Ekman’s six basic emotions that are directed towards entities. It is based on linguistic rules to incorporate the
benefit of semantics without relying on costly human annotation. The performance of ‘RELATE’ is evaluated by learning SSE
representations using a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN).

As online communication grows, memes have con- tinued to evolve and circulate as succinct multi- modal forms of communication. However, compu- tational approaches applied to meme-related lack the same depth and contextual sensitivity of non- computational approaches and struggle to interpret intra-modal dynamics and referentiality. This re- search proposes to a ‘meme genealogy’ of key fea- tures and relationships between memes to inform a knowledge base constructed from meme-specific online sources and embed connotative meaning and contextual information in memes. The proposed methods provide a basis to train contextually sensi- tive computational models for analysing memes and applications in automated meme annotation.

Possible sensory failures on monitoring systems re- sult in partially filled data which may lead to erroneous statistical conclusions which may affect critical systems such as pollutant detectors and anomaly activity detectors. Therefore imputation becomes necessary to decrease error. This work addresses the missing data problem by experimenting with various methods in the context of a water quality dataset with high miss rates. Compared models chosen make different assumptions about the data which are Generative Adversarial Networks, Multiple Im- putation by Chained Equations, Variational Auto-Encoders, and Recurrent Neural Networks. A novel recurrent neural network architecture with self-attention is proposed in which imputation is done in a single pass. The proposed model performs with a lower root mean square error, ranging between 0.012-0.28, in three of the four locations. The self-attention components increase the interpretability of the imputation process at each stage of the network, providing information to domain experts.

Offshore wind turbine monopiles require structural health monitoring throughout their lifespan, yet direct structural measurements are limited. This paper combines numerical modeling and machine learning to present an approach to obtain rapid estimations of monopile fatigue using hourly metocean conditions. Aero-hydro-servo-elastic numerical simulations for a reference turbine provide the meta-model training dataset that encompasses wind-wave conditions applicable to the North Sea. Analysis reveals conditions whereby higher-order fully non-linear wave kinematics produce larger damage values compared to linear waves. This increase in damage is absent when implementing a simple probabilistic data lumping method. The prototype meta-model is developed based on convolutional neural networks to determine the monopile damage from measured wind-wave conditions at high temporal frequency. The proof-of-concept meta-model provides a step-change that demonstrates a promising approach to estimate monopile fatigue accumulation at high temporal resolution with scope for development to specific real-world offshore wind farms where validation data is available.

 Accurate and efficient assessment of offshore wind turbine monopile fatigue is required to inform maintenance and decommissioning decision making. Although, direct field-based measurements are limited and current industry standard f
  approaches are often devoid of fully non-linear waves, thus omitting critically important resonance effects. Here, numerical modelling is combined with machine learning to develop a meta-model capable of rapidly estimating monopile damage and fatigue. Fully non-linear wave kinematics were numerically modelled using higher-order boundary element methods to represent conditions recorded in the North Sea. These environmental simulations were implemented within numerical areo-hydro-servo-elastic engineering modelling of a reference turbine (NREL 5MW) with monopile foundations, for both operational and parked turbine configurations across a range of incoming wind conditions. The modelled fore-aft tower base bending moments are used to estimate of the corresponding structural damage using rainflow-counting methods, enabling identification of conditions associated with the largest damage loads. These data are applied within the development a meta-model based on convolutional neural networks to provide rapid assessment of monopile damage associated with any given environmental and operational condition.

Climate change will affect how water sources are managed and monitored. Continuous monitoring of water quality is crucial to detect pollution, to ensure that various natural cycles are not disrupted by anthropogenic activities and to assess the effec- tiveness of beneficial management measures taken under defined protocols. One such disruption is algal blooms in which population of phytoplank- ton increase rapidly affecting biodiversity in marine environments. The frequency of algal blooms will in- crease with climate change as it presents favourable conditions for reproduction of phytoplankton. Ma- chine learning has been used for early detection of algal blooms previously, with the focus mostly on single closed bodies of water in Far East Asia with short time ranges. In this work, we study four locations around the North Sea and the Irish Sea with different characteristics predicting activity with longer time-spans and explaining the importance of the input for the decision making process with regards to the prediction model. This work aids domain experts to monitor potential changes to the ecosystem done by human interference over longer time ranges and to take action when necessary.

Classical measurements and modelling that underpin present flood warning and alert systems are based on fixed and spa- tially restricted static sensor networks. Computationally ex- pensive physics-based simulations are often used that can’t react in real-time to changes in environmental conditions. We want to explore contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) for predicting flood risk in real time by using a diverse range of data sources. By combining heterogeneous data sources, we aim to nowcast rapidly changing flood conditions and gain a greater understanding of urgent humanitarian needs.

	Wind energy has emerged as a highly promising source of renewable energy in recent times. However, wind turbines regularly suffer from operational inconsistencies, leading to significant costs and challenges in operations and maintenance (O&M). Condition-based monitoring (CBM) and performance assessment/analysis of turbines are vital aspects for ensuring efficient O&M planning and cost minimisation. Data-driven decision making techniques have witnessed rapid evolution in the wind industry for such O&M tasks during the last decade, from applying signal processing methods in early 2010 to artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, especially deep learning in 2020. In this article, we utilise statistical computing to present a scientometric review of the conceptual and thematic evolution of AI in the wind energy sector, providing evidence-based insights into present strengths and limitations of data-driven decision making in the wind industry. We provide a perspective into the future and on current key challenges in data availability and quality, lack of transparency in black box-natured AI models, and prevailing issues in deploying models for real-time decision support, along with possible strategies to overcome these problems. We hope that a systematic analysis of the past, present and future of CBM and performance assessment can encourage more organisations to adopt data-driven decision making techniques in O&M towards making wind energy sources more reliable, contributing to the global efforts of tackling climate change.

										Current approaches that generate text from linked data for complex real-world domains can face problems including rich and sparse vocabularies as well as learning from examples of long varied sequences. In this article, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer approach that automatically induces a hierarchy of “generation spaces” from a dataset of semantic concepts and texts. Generation spaces are based on a notion of similarity of partial knowledge graphs that represent the domain and feed into a hierarchy of sequence-to-sequence or memory-to-sequence learners for concept-to-text generation. An advantage of our approach is that learning models are exposed to the most relevant examples during training which can avoid bias towards majority samples. We evaluate our approach on two common benchmark datasets and compare our hierarchical approach against a flat learning setup. We also conduct a comparison between sequence-to-sequence and memory-to-sequence learning models. Experiments show that our hierarchical approach overcomes issues of data sparsity and learns robust lexico-syntactic patterns, consistently outperforming flat baselines and previous work by up to 30%. We also find that while memory-to-sequence models can outperform sequence-to-sequence models in some cases, the latter are generally more stable in their performance and represent a safer overall choice.

										Recent statistics in suicide prevention show that people are increasingly posting their last words online and with the
unprecedented availability of textual data from social media platforms researchers have the opportunity to analyse such data.
Furthermore, psychological studies have shown that our state of mind can manifest itself in the linguistic features we use to
communicate. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to automatically identify suicide notes from other types of social media
blogs in two document-level classification tasks. The first task aims to identify suicide notes from depressed and blog posts in a
balanced dataset, whilst the second experiment looks at how well suicide notes can be classified when there is a vast amount of
neutral text data, which makes the task more applicable to real-world scenarios. Furthermore we perform a linguistic analysis using
LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count). We present a learning model for modelling long sequences in two experiment series. We
achieve an f1-score of 88.26% over the baselines of 0.60 in experiment 1 and 96.1% over the baseline in experiment 2. Finally, we
show through visualisations which features the learning model identifies, these include emotions such as love and personal pronouns.

										Condition-based monitoring (CBM) has been widely utilised in the wind industry for monitoring operational inconsistencies and failures in turbines,
with techniques ranging from signal processing and vibration analysis to
artificial intelligence (AI) models using Supervisory Control & Acquisition
(SCADA) data. However, existing studies do not present a concrete basis to facilitate explainable decision support in operations and maintenance
(O&M), particularly for automated decision support through recommendation of appropriate maintenance action reports corresponding to failures predicted by CBM techniques. Knowledge graph databases (KGs) model a
collection of domain-specific information and have played an intrinsic role
for real-world decision support in domains such as healthcare and finance,
but have seen very limited attention in the wind industry. We propose
XAI4Wind, a multimodal knowledge graph for explainable decision support
in real-world operational turbines and demonstrate through experiments several use-cases of the proposed KG towards O&M planning through interactive
query and reasoning and providing novel insights using graph data science
algorithms. The proposed KG combines multimodal knowledge like SCADA
parameters and alarms with natural language maintenance actions, images
etc. By integrating our KG with an Explainable AI model for anomaly prediction, we show that it can provide effective human-intelligible O&M strategies
for predicted operational inconsistencies in various turbine sub-components.
This can help instil better trust and confidence in conventionally black-box
AI models. We make our KG publicly available and envisage that it can
serve as the building ground for providing autonomous decision support in
the wind industry.

				With growing natural disasters, rise in carbon emissions and faltering ecosystems, the need for furthering research in climate change has become integral. Recent studies have shown that data science can play a vital role in better understanding natural phenomena and discovering novel insights. Although no silver bullet, machine learning (ML) has been successfully utilised in an array of applications, ranging from prediction and assessment of droughts and floods, energy control in grids, water quality modelling, operations & maintenance (O&M) of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy etc. However, the existing studies suffer from 2 prime challenges: (1) Lack of data availability - domain specific information e.g. from wind turbines, is often commercially sensitive, making it difficult to procure large amounts of useable data - especially new kinds of data which can possibly generate significant new insights. Transfer learning techniques can help learn from little or no labelled data, ensuring accuracy and helping algorithms to generalise better. (2) The black-box nature of (deep) ML models makes them suffer from the problem of transparency, wherein, although predictions can often be made with high accuracy, confidence and trust in the model decisions is difficult. A human intelligible diagnosis of when, why, what and how a model performs (or not) is essential. Hybrid ML techniques can bridge the gap between transparency and accuracy, and causal inference can help discover hidden insights from data. Natural language generation can further help in generating informative reports and descriptions of natural disasters and O&M strategies for renewable energy sources. We propose a perspective to tackle some of these challenges in ensuring reliable decision making and envisage that making data-driven decision support systems intelligent and transparent would have a significant impact in tackling climate change.			</details>

	As global efforts in transitioning to sustainable energy sources rise, wind energy has become a leading renewable energy resource. However, turbines are complex engineering systems and rely on effective operations & maintenance (O&M) to prevent catastrophic failures in sub-components (gearbox, generator, etc.). Wind turbines have multiple sensors embedded within their sub-components which regularly measure key internal and external parameters (generator bearing temperature, rotor speed, wind speed etc.) in the form of Supervisory Control & Data Acquisition (SCADA) data. While existing studies have focused on applying ML techniques towards anomaly prediction in turbines based on SCADA data, they have not been supported with transparent decisions, owing to the inherent black box nature of ML models. In this project, we aim to explore transparent and intelligent decision support in O&M of turbines, by predicting faults and providing human-intelligible maintenance strategies to avert and fix the underlying causes. We envisage that in contributing to explainable AI for the wind industry, our method would help make turbines more reliable, encouraging more organisations to switch to renewable energy sources for combating climate change.

										Artificial gene regulatory networks (AGRNs) are connectionist architectures inspired by biological gene regulation capable of solving tasks within complex dynamical systems. The implementation of an operational
layer inspired by epigenetic mechanisms has been shown to improve the performance of AGRNs, and improve
their transparency by providing a degree of explainability. In this paper, we apply artificial epigenetic layers
(AELs) to two trained deep neural networks (DNNs) in order to gain an understanding of their internal workings, by determining which parts of the network are required at a particular point in time, and which nodes
are not used at all. The AEL consists of artificial epigenetic molecules (AEMs) that dynamically interact with
nodes within the DNNs to allow for the selective deactivation of parts of the network.

										Offshore wind farm operators need to make short-term decisions on planning vessel transfers to turbines for preventive or corrective maintenance. These decisions can play a pivotal role in ensuring maintenance actions are carried out in a timely and cost-effective manner. The present optimization of offshore vessel transfer uses mathematical models rather than learning decisions from historical data. In this paper, we design a simulated environment for an offshore wind farm based on Supervisory Control & Acquisition (SCADA) data and alarm logs of historical faults in an operational turbine. Firstly, we utilise a state-of-art decision tree model to predict fault types using SCADA features, and provide explainable decisions. Next, we apply deep reinforcement learning to automatically learn maintenance priorities corresponding to different fault types for ensuring prioritized vessel transfers for critical conditions, and deciding on optimal vessel fleet size. This can lead to significant savings in maintenance costs for the offshore wind industry.

										Machine learning techniques have been widely used for condition-based monitoring
of wind turbines using Supervisory Control & Acquisition (SCADA) data. However, many
machine learning models, including neural networks, operate as black boxes: despite performing
suitably well as predictive models, they are not able to identify causal associations within
the data. For data-driven system to approach human-level intelligence in generating effective
maintenance strategies, it is integral to discover hidden knowledge in the operational data. In
this paper, we apply deep learning to discover causal relationships between multiple features
(confounders) in SCADA data for faults in various sub-components from an operational turbine
using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with attention. Our technique overcomes the black
box nature of conventional deep learners and identifies hidden confounders in the data through
the use of temporal causal graphs. We demonstrate the effects of SCADA features on a wind
turbine’s operational status, and show that our technique contributes to explainable AI for wind
energy applications by providing transparent and interpretable decision support.

										The last decade has witnessed an increased interest in applying machine learning techniques to predict faults and anomalies in the operation of wind turbines. These e�orts have lately been dominated by deep learning techniques which, as in other �elds, tend to outperform traditional machine learning algorithms given su�cient amounts of training data. An important shortcoming of deep learning models is their lack of transparency – they operate as black boxes and typically do not provide rationales for their predictions, which can lead to a lack of trust in predicted out- puts. In this article, a novel hybrid model for anomaly prediction in wind farms is proposed, that combines a recurrent neural network approach for accurate classi�cation with an XGBoost deci- sion tree classi�er for transparent outputs. Experiments with an o�shore wind turbine show that our model achieves a classi�cation accuracy of up to 97%. The model is further able to generate detailed feature importance analyses for any detected anomalies, identifying exactly those com- ponents in a wind turbine that contribute to an anomaly. Finally, the feasibility of transfer learning is demonstrated for the wind domain by porting our “o�shore" model to an unseen dataset from an onshore wind farm. The latter model achieves an accuracy of 65% and is able to detect 85% of anomalies in the unseen domain. These results are encouraging for application to wind farms for which no training data is available, e.g. because they have not been in operation for long.

										Wind energy is one of the fastest-growing sustainable energy sources in the world but relies crucially on efficient and effective operations and maintenance to generate sufficient amounts of energy and reduce downtime of wind turbines and associated costs. Machine learning has been applied to fault prediction in wind turbines, but these predictions have not been supported with suggestions on how to avert and fix faults. We present a data-to-text generation system utilising transformers for generating corrective maintenance strategies for faults using SCADA data capturing the operational status of turbines. We achieve this in two stages: a first stage identifies faults based on SCADA input features and their relevance. A second stage performs content selection for the language generation task and creates maintenance strategies based on phrase-based natural language templates. Experiments show that our dual transformer model achieves an accuracy of up to 96.75% for alarm prediction and up to 75.35% for its choice of maintenance strategies during content-selection. A qualitative analysis shows that our generated maintenance strategies are promising. We make our human- authored maintenance templates publicly available, and include a brief video explaining our approach.

										The global pursuit towards sustainable development is leading to increased adaptation of renewable energy sources. Wind turbines are
promising sources of clean energy, but regularly suffer from failures
and down-times, primarily due to the complex environments and
unpredictable conditions wherein they are deployed. While various
studies have earlier utilised machine learning techniques for fault
prediction in turbines, their black-box nature hampers explainability and trust in decision making. We propose the application of
causal reasoning in operations & maintenance of wind turbines using Supervisory Control & Acquisition (SCADA) data, and harness
attention-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify
hidden associations between different parameters contributing to
failures in the form of temporal causal graphs. By interpreting these
non-obvious relationships (many of which may have potentially
been disregarded as noise), engineers can plan ahead for unforeseen
failures, helping make wind power sources more reliable.

										We propose a novel approach for fine-grained emotion classification in tweets using a Bidirectional Dilated LSTM (BiDLSTM) with attention. Conventional LSTM architectures can face problems when classifying long sequences, which is problematic for tweets, where
crucial information is often attached to the end of a sequence, e.g. an emoticon. We show that by adding a bidirectional layer, dilations and attention mechanism to a standard LSTM, our model overcomes these problems and is able to maintain complex data
dependencies over time. We present experiments with two datasets,
the 2018 WASSA Implicit Emotions Shared Task and a new dataset
of 240,000 tweets. Our BiDLSTM with attention achieves a test
accuracy of up to 81.97% outperforming competitive baselines by
up to 10.52% on both datasets. Finally, we evaluate our data against
a human benchmark on the same task.

										Wind turbines suffer from operational inconsistencies due to a variety of factors, ranging from environmental changes, to intrinsic anomalies in specific components, such as gearbox, generator, pitch system etc.  Condition monitoring of wind turbines has been a critical research area in the last decade, wherein the Supervisory Control & Data Acquisition (SCADA) data is used to analyse the operational behaviour of the turbine and predict any incipient faults to prevent catastrophic losses caused by unexpected failures. Machine learning models have formed a large part of the data-analytics based methods used for learning from historical failures through supervised learning, but they suffer from the lack of ability to provide additional capabilities for learning with little labelled data, or for that matter, no labelled faults in a different domain. Deep learning has shown immense success in areas where time-series data is to be modelled. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning model combining a Long short-term memory network (LSTM) with XGBoost, a decision tree-based classifier for providing the benefits of accuracy through deep learning, and transparency through traditional decision trees. Our study shows that Transfer learning allows us to make predictions with increasing accuracy on unseen data; which is useful for simulations of new operations, new wind farms or other cases of non-available training data. This can help reduce downtime of turbines through predictive maintenance, by predicting incipient faults, or provide corrective maintenance, by assisting the engineers and technicians to analyse the root causes behind the failure, thus contributing to the reliability and uptake of wind energy as a sustainable and promising domain.

										</summary>
										Wind energy is one of the fastest-growing sustainable energy sources in the world
but relies crucially on efficient and effective operations and maintenance to generate
sufficient amounts of energy and reduce downtime of wind turbines and associated
costs. Machine learning has been applied to fault prediction in wind turbines,
but these predictions have not been supported with suggestions on how to avert
and fix faults. We present a data-to-text generation system using transformers to
produce event descriptions from SCADA data capturing the operational status of
turbines and proposing maintenance strategies. Experiments show that our model
learns feature representations that correspond to expert judgements. In making a
contribution to the reliability of wind energy, we hope to encourage organisations
to switch to sustainable energy sources and help combat climate change.

										Recent statistics in suicide prevention show that people are increasingly posting
their last words online and with the unprecedented availability of textual data
from social media platforms researchers have the opportunity to analyse such data.
Furthermore, psychological studies have shown that our state of mind can manifest
itself in the linguistic features we use to communicate. In this paper, we investigate
whether it is possible to automatically identify suicide notes from other types of
social media blogs in a document-level classification task. Also, we present a
learning model for modelling long sequences, achieving an f1-score of 0.84 over
the baselines of 0.53 and 0.80 (best competing model). Finally, we also show
through visualisations which features the learning model identifies.

										In this paper we present a dilated LSTM with
attention mechanism for document-level classification of suicide notes, last statements and
depressed notes. We achieve an accuracy of
87.34% compared to competitive baselines of
80.35% (Logistic Model Tree) and 82.27%
(Bi-directional LSTM with Attention). Furthermore, we provide an analysis of both the
grammatical and thematic content of suicide
notes, last statements and depressed notes. We
find that the use of personal pronouns, cognitive processes and references to loved ones are
most important. Finally, we show through visualisations of attention weights that the Dilated LSTM with attention is able to identify
the same distinguishing features across documents as the linguistic analysis.

Pluricentric languages play an important role in such work, particularly where these languages are better resourced. Dedicated researchers across several decades, have steadily contributed resources for some language varieties, increasing general availability of a range of data archives...

										Modularity is a feature of found in biological systems where it is common for functionally related processes to
evolve to be individually discrete units. Such traits are prevelant
in prokaryotic genomes. This work aims to understand to
what extent artificial gene regulatory networks AGRNs, which
take inspiration from gene regulation in nature will self-divide
into modular task specific sub-networks consisting of multiple
interacting nodes when solving multiple complex tasks. To
investigate this, we evolve AGRNs to solve three different tasks
with ranging dynamics simultaneously and evaluate the network
structure. From this we aim to build an understanding of whether
modularity in AGRNs is fundamental to solving multiple tasks
and what effect the nature of the tasks being solved has on
modularity within the networks.

										With the rising costs of conventional sources of en- ergy, the world is moving towards sustainable energy sources including wind energy. Wind turbines consist of several electrical and mechanical components and experience an enormous amount of irregular loads, making their operational behaviour at times inconsis- tent. Operations and Maintenance (O&M) is a key factor in monitoring such inconsistent behaviour of the turbines in order to predict and prevent any in- cipient faults which may occur in the near future.

										Evolutionary processes such as convergent evolution and rapid adaptation which suggest that there are constraints on how organisms evolve. Without constraint, such processes would most likely not be possible in the time frame in which they are seen. This paper investigates how artificial gene regulatory networks (GRNs), a connectionist architecture designed for computational problem solving may too be constrained in its evolutionary pathway. To understand this further, GRNs are applied to two different computational tasks and the way their underlying genes evolve over time is observed. From this, rules about how often genes are evolved and how this correlates with thier connectivity within the GRN are deduced. By generating and applying these rules, we can build an understanding of how GRNs are constrained in their evolutionary path, and build measures to exploit this to improve evolutionary performance and speed.

										With the greater availability of linguistic data from public social media platforms and the advancements of natural language processing, a number of opportunities have arisen for researchers to analyse this type of data. Research efforts have mostly focused on detecting the polarity of textual data, evaluating whether there is positive, negative or sometimes neutral content. Especially the use of neural networks has recently yielded significant results in polarity detection experiments. In this paper we present a more fine-grained approach to detecting sentiment in textual data, particularly analysing a corpus of suicide notes, depressive notes and love notes. We achieve a classification accuracy of 71.76% when classifying based on text and sentiment features, and an accuracy of 69.41% when using the words present in the notes alone. We discover that while emotions in all three datasets overlap, each of them has a unique ‘emotion profile’ which allows us to draw conclusions about the potential mental state that is reflects. Using the emotion sequences only, we achieve an accuracy of 75.29%. The results from unannotated data, while worse than the other models, nevertheless represent an encouraging step towards being able to flag potentially harmful social media posts online and in real time. We provide a high-level corpus analysis of the data sets in order to demonstrate the grammatical and emotional differences.

										Stochastic natural language generation systems that are trained from labelled datasets are often domain-specific in their annotation and in their mapping from semantic input representations to lexical-syntactic outputs. As a result, learnt models fail to generalize across domains, heavily restricting their usability beyond single applications. In this article, we focus on the problem of domain adaptation for natural language generation. We show how linguistic knowledge from a source domain, for which labelled data is available, can be adapted to a target domain by reusing training data across domains. As a key to this, we propose to employ abstract meaning representations as a common semantic representation across domains. We model natural language generation as a long short- term memory recurrent neural network encoder-decoder, in which one recurrent neural network learns a latent representation of a semantic input, and a second recurrent neural network learns to decode it to a sequence of words. We show that the learnt representations can be transferred across domains and can be leveraged effectively to improve training on new unseen domains. Experiments in three different domains and with six datasets demonstrate that the lexical-syntactic constructions learnt in one domain can be transferred to new domains and achieve up to 75-100% of the performance of in-domain training. This is based on objective metrics such as BLEU and semantic error rate and a subjective human rating study. Training a policy from prior knowledge from a different domain is consistently better than pure in-domain training by up to 10%.

										This paper describes how the recurrent connectionist architecture epiNet, which is capable of dynamically modifying its topology, is able to provide a form of transparent execution. EpiNet, which is inspired by eukaryotic gene regulation in nature, is able to break its own architecture down into sets of smaller interacting networks. This allows for autonomous complex task decomposition, and by analysing these smaller interacting networks, it is possible to provide a real world understanding of why specific decisions have been made. We expect this work to be useful in fields where the risk of improper decision making is high, such as medical simulations, diagnostics and financial modelling. To test this hypothesis we apply epiNet to two data sets within UCI’s machine learning repository, each of which requires a specific set of behaviours to solve. We then perform analysis on the overall functionality of epiNet in order to deduce the underlying rules behind its functionality and in turn provide transparency of execution.

										Deep learning has recently been adopted for the task of natural language generation (NLG) and shown remarkable results. However, learning can go awry when the input dataset is too small or not well balanced with regards to the examples it contains for various input sequences. This is relevant to naturally occurring datasets such as many that were not prepared for the task of natural language processing but scraped off the web and originally prepared for a different purpose. As a mitigation to the problem of unbalanced training data, we therefore propose to decompose a large natural language dataset into several subsets that “talk about” the same thing. We show that the decomposition helps to focus each learner’s attention during training. Results from a proof-of-concept study show 73% times faster learning over a flat model and better results.

										Recent years have seen a surge of interest in deep learning models that outperform other machine learning algorithms on benchmarks across many disciplines. Most existing deep learning libraries facilitate the development of neural nets by providing a mathematical framework that helps users implement their models more efficiently. This still represents a substantial investment of time and effort, however, when the intention is to compare a range of competing models quickly for a specific task. We present DEFIne, a fluent interface DSL for the specification, optimisation and evaluation of deep learning models. The fluent interface is implemented through method chaining. DEFIne is embedded in Python and is build on top of its most popular deep learning libraries, Keras and Theano. It extends these with common operations for data pre-processing and representation as well as visualisation of datasets and results. We test our framework on three benchmark tasks from different domains: heart disease diagnosis, hand-written digit recognition and weather forecast generation. Results in terms of accuracy, runtime and lines of code show that our DSL achieves equivalent accuracy and runtime to state-of-the-art models, while requiring only about 10 lines of code per application.

										Currently, an estimated 36 million people worldwide are affected by Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias. In the absence of a cure, non-pharmacological interventions, such as cognitive stimulation, which slow down the rate of deterioration can benefit people with dementia and their caregivers. Such interven- tions have shown to improve well-being and slow down the rate of cognitive decline. It has further been shown that cognitive stimulation in interaction with a computer is as effective as with a human. However, the need to operate a computer often repre- sents a difficulty for the elderly and stands in the way of widespread adoption. A possible solution to this obstacle is to provide a spoken natural language interface that allows people with dementia to interact with the cognitive stimulation software in the same way as they would interact with a human caregiver. This makes the assistive technology accessible to users regardless of their technical skills and provides a fully intuitive user experience. This article describes a pilot study that evaluated the feasibility of computer-based cognitive stimulation through a spoken natural language interface. A prototype software was evaluated with 23 users, including healthy elderly people and people with dementia. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive.

										[Book abstract] In the past 10 years, very few published studies include some kind of extrinsic evaluation of an NLG component in an end-to-end-system, be it for phone or mobile-based dialogues or social robotic interaction. This may be attributed to the fact that these types of evaluations are very costly to set-up and run for a single component. The question therefore arises whether there is anything to be gained over and above intrinsic quality measures obtained in off-line experiments? In this article, we describe a case study of evaluating two variants of an NLG surface realiser and show that there are significant differences in both extrinsic measures and intrinsic measures. These differences can be used to inform further iterations of component and system development.

										Psychological studies have shown that our state of mind can manifest itself in the linguistic features we use to communicate. Recent statistics in suicide prevention show that young people are increasingly posting their last words online. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to automatically identify suicide notes and discern them from other types of online discourse based on analysis of sentiments and linguistic features. Using supervised learning, we show that our model achieves an accuracy of 86.6%, outperforming previous work on a similar task by over 4%.

										Incremental dialogue systems are often perceived as more responsive and natural because they are able to address phenomena of turn-taking and overlapping speech, such as backchannels or barge-ins. Previous work in this area has often identified distinctive prosodic features, or features relating to syntactic or semantic completeness, as marking appropriate places of turn-taking. In a separate strand of work, psycholinguistic studies have established a connection between information density and prominence in language—the less expected a linguistic unit is in a particular context, the more likely it is to be linguistically marked. This has been observed across linguistic levels, including the prosodic, which plays an important role in predicting overlapping speech.
										In this article, we explore the hypothesis that information density (ID) also plays a role in turn-taking. Specifically, we aim to show that humans are sensitive to the peaks and troughs of information density in speech, and that over-lapping speech at ID troughs is perceived as more acceptable than overlaps at ID peaks. To test our hypothesis, we collect human ratings for three models of generating overlapping speech based on features of: (1) prosody and semantic or syntactic completeness, (2) information density, and (3) both types of	information. Results show that over 50% of users preferred the version using both types of features, followed by a preference for information density features alone. This indicates a clear human sensitivity to the effects of information density in spoken language and provides a strong motivation to adopt this metric for the design, development and evaluation of turn-taking modules in spoken and incremental dialogue systems.

										In the past 10 years, only around 15% of published conference papers include some kind of extrinsic evaluation of an NLG component in an end-to-end system. These types of evaluations are costly to set-up and run, so is it worth it? Is there anything to be gained over and above intrinsic quality measures obtained in off-line experiments? In this paper, we describe a case study of evaluating two variants of an NLG surface realiser and show that there are significant differences in both extrinsic measures and intrinsic measures. These significant differences would need to be factored into future iterations of the component and therefore, we con- clude that extrinsic evaluations are worthwhile.

										Natural Language Generation systems in interactive settings often face a multitude of choices, given that the communicative effect of each utterance they generate depends crucially on the interplay between its physical circumstances, addressee and interaction history. This is particularly true in interactive and situated settings. In this paper we present a novel approach for situated Natural Language Generation in dialogue that is based on hierarchical reinforcement learning and learns the best utterance for a context by optimisation through trial and error. The model is trained from human–human corpus data and learns particularly to balance the trade-off between efficiency and detail in giving instructions: the user needs to be given sufficient information to execute their task, but without exceeding their cognitive load. We present results from simulation and a task-based human evaluation study comparing two different versions of hierarchical reinforcement learning: One operates using a hierarchy of policies with a large state space and local knowledge, and the other additionally shares knowledge across generation subtasks to enhance performance. Results show that sharing knowledge across subtasks achieves better performance than learning in isolation, leading to smoother and more successful interactions that are better perceived by human users.

										Learning systems or robots that interact with their environment by perceiving,
acting or communicating often face a challenge in how to bring these different
concepts together. This challenge arises because core concepts are typically
studied within their respective communities, such as the computer vision,
robotics and natural language processing communities, among others. A commonality
across communities is the use of machine learning techniques and algorithms.
In this way, machine learning is crucial in the development of truly
intelligent systems, not just by providing techniques and algorithms, but also by
acting as a unifying factor across communities, encouraging communication,
discussion and exchange of ideas. [...]

										Surface realisations typically depend on their target style and audience. A challenge in estimating a stylistic realiser from data is that humans vary significantly in their subjective perceptions of linguistic forms and styles, leading to almost no correlation between ratings of the same utterance. We address this problem in two steps. First, we estimate a mapping function between the linguistic features of a corpus of utterances and their human style ratings. Users are partitioned into clusters based on the similarity of their ratings, so that ratings for new utterances can be estimated, even for new, unknown users. In a second step, the estimated model is used to re-rank the outputs of a number of surface realisers to produce stylistically adaptive output. Results confirm that the generated styles are recognisable to human judges and that predictive models based on clusters of users lead to better rating predictions than models based on an average population of users.

										Work on training semantic slot labellers for use in Natural Language Processing applications has typically either relied on large amounts of labelled input data, or has assumed entirely unlabelled inputs. The former technique tends to be costly to apply, while the latter is often not as accurate as its supervised counterpart. Here, we present a semi-supervised learning approach that automatically labels the semantic slots in a set of training data and aims to strike a balance between the dependence on labelled data and prediction accuracy. The essence of our algorithm is to cluster clauses based on a similarity function that combines lexical and semantic information. We present experiments that compare different similarity functions for both our semi-supervised setting and a fully unsupervised baseline. While semi-supervised learning expectedly outperforms unsupervised learning, our results show that (1) this effect can be observed based on very few training data instances and that increasing the size of the training data does not lead to better performance, and (2) that lexical and semantic information contribute differently in different domains so that clustering based on both types of information offers the best generalisation.

										Training a statistical surface realiser typically relies on labelled training data or parallel data sets, such as corpora of paraphrases. The procedure for obtaining such data for new domains is not only time-consuming, but it also restricts the incorporation of new semantic slots during an interaction, i.e. using an online learning scenario for automatically extended domains. Here, we present an alternative approach to statistical surface realisation from unlabelled data through automatic semantic slot labelling. The essence of our algorithm is to cluster clauses based on a similarity function that combines lexical and semantic information. Annotations need to be reliable enough to be utilised within a spoken dialogue system. We compare different similarity functions and evaluate our surface realiser—trained from unlabelled data—in a human rating study. Results confirm that a surface realiser trained from automatic slot labels can lead to outputs of comparable quality to outputs trained from human-labelled inputs.

									Conversational systems and robots that use reinforcement learning for policy optimization in large domains often face the problem of limited scalability. This problem has been addressed either by using function approximation techniques that estimate the approximate true value function of a policy or by using a hierarchical decomposition of a learning task into subtasks. We present a novel approach for dialogue policy optimization that combines the benefits of both hierarchical control and function approximation and that allows flexible transitions between dialogue subtasks to give human users more control over the dialogue. To this end, each reinforcement learning agent in the hierarchy is extended with a subtask transition function and a dynamic state space to allow flexible switching between subdialogues. In addition, the subtask policies are represented with linear function approximation in order to generalize the decision making to situations unseen in training. Our proposed approach is evaluated in an interactive conversational robot that learns to play quiz games. Experimental results, using simulation and real users, provide evidence that our proposed approach can lead to more flexible (natural) interactions than strict hierarchical control and that it is preferred by human users.

										Context-sensitive Natural Language Generation is concerned with the automatic generation of system output that is in several ways adaptive to its target audience or the situational circumstances of its production. In this article, I will provide an overview of the most popular methods that have been applied to context-sensitive generation. A particular focus will be on the shift from knowledge-driven to data- driven approaches that has been witnessed in the last decade. While this shift has offered powerful new methods for large-scale adaptivity and flexible output generation, purely data-driven approaches still struggle to reach the linguistic depth of their knowledge-driven predecessors. Bridging the gap between both types of approaches is therefore an important future research direction.

										This special issue highlights research articles that apply machine learning to robots and other systems that interact with users through more than one modality, such as speech, gestures, and vision. For example, a robot may coordinate its speech with its actions, taking into account (audio-)visual feedback during their execution. Machine learning provides interactive systems with opportunities to improve performance not only of individual components but also of the system as a whole. However, machine learning methods that encompass multiple modalities of an interactive system are still relatively hard to find. The articles in this special issue represent examples that contribute to filling this gap.

										Evaluations of dialogue systems and language generators often rely on subjective user ratings to assess output quality and performance. Humans however vary in their preferences so that estimating an accurate prediction model is difficult. Using a method that clusters utterances based on their linguistic features and ratings (Dethlefs et al., 2014), we discuss the possibility of obtaining user feedback implicitly during an interaction. This approach promises better predictions of user preferences through continuous re-estimation.

									We demonstrate two alternative frameworks for testing and evaluating spoken dialogue systems on mobile devices for use “in the wild”. We firstly present a spoken dialogue system that uses third party ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and TTS (Text-To-Speech) components and then present an alternative using audio compression to allow for entire systems with home-grown ASR/TTS to be plugged in directly. Some advantages and drawbacks of both are discussed.

										Surface realisers in spoken dialogue systems need to be more responsive than conventional surface realisers. They need to be sensitive to the utterance context as well as robust to partial or changing generator inputs. We formulate surface realisation as a sequence labelling task and combine the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) with semantic trees. Due to their extended notion of context, CRFs are able to take the global utterance context into account and are less constrained by local features than other realisers. This leads to more natural and less repetitive surface realisation. It also allows generation from partial and modified inputs and is therefore applicable to incremental surface realisation. Results from a human rating study confirm that users are sensitive to this extended notion of context and assign ratings that are significantly higher (up to 14%) than those for taking only local context into account.

										Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems typically face an uncertainty regarding the best utterance to communicate to a user in a given context given that the effect of a single utterance depends crucially on the interplay between its physical environment, pragmatic circumstances, addressee and interaction history. NLG system designers have traditionally used a pipeline architecture to divide the generation process into the distinct stages of content selection, utterance planning and surface realisation to choose the semantics, organisation and realisation of an utterance. Unfortunately, this sequential model does not account for the interdependencies that exist among these stages, which in practice has been manifest in inefficient instruction giving and an increased cognitive load for the user. 
										This thesis will advocate a joint optimisation framework for situated NLG that is based on Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning combined with graphical models and will learn the best utterance for a given context by optimising its behaviour through a trial and error search. The joint model considers decisions at different NLG stages in interdependence with each other and thereby produces more context-sensitive utterances than is possible when considering decisions in isolation. To enhance the human-likeness of the model, two augmentations will be made. We will introduce the notion of a Hierarchical Information State to support the systematic pre-specification of prior knowledge and human preferences for content selection. Graphical models—Hidden Markov Models and Bayesian Networks—will then be integrated as generation spaces to encourage natural surface realisation by balancing the proportion of alignment and variation.
										Results from a human evaluation study show that the hierarchical learning agent learns a robust generation policy that adapts to new circumstances and users flexibly leading to smooth and successful interactions. In terms of the comparison between a joint and an isolated optimisation, results indicate that a jointly optimised system achieves higher user satisfaction and task success and is better perceived by human users than its isolated counterpart. To demonstrate the domain-independence and generalisabilty of the hierarchical joint optimisation framework, an additional study will be presented that transfers the model to a new, but related, domain: the generation of route instructions in a real navigation scenario using a situated dialogue system for indoor navigation. Results confirm that the NLG policy can be applied to new domains with limited effort and contribute to high task success and user satisfaction.

										A challenge in dialogue act recognition is the mapping from noisy user inputs to dialogue acts. In this paper we describe an approach for re-ranking dialogue act hypotheses based on Bayesian classifiers that incorporate dialogue history and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) N-best information. We report results based on the Let’s Go dialogue corpora that show (1) that including ASR N-best information results in improved dialogue act recognition performance (+7% accuracy), and (2) that competitive results can be obtained from as early as the first system dialogue act, reducing the need to wait for subsequent system dialogue acts.

										Intelligent systems or robots that interact with their environment by perceiving, acting or communicating often face a challenge in how to bring these different concepts together. One of the main reasons for this challenge is the fact that the core concepts in perception, action and communication are typically studied by different communities: the computer vision, robotics and natural language processing communities, among others, without much interchange between them. Learning systems that encompass perception, action and communication in a unified and principled way are still rare. As machine learning lies at the core of these communities, it can act as a unifying factor in bringing the communities closer together. Unifying these communities is highly important for understanding how state-of-the-art approaches from different disciplines can be combined (and applied) to form generally interactive intelligent systems. MLIS-2013 aims to bring researchers from multiple disciplines together that are in some way or another affected by the gap between perception, action and communication. Our goal is to provide a forum for interdisciplinary discussion that allows researchers to look at their work from new perspectives that go beyond their core community and develop new interdisciplinary collaborations.

										Research on interactive systems and robots, i.e. interactive machines that perceive, act and communicate, has applied a multitude of different machine learning frameworks in recent years, many of which are based on a form of reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we will provide a brief introduction to the application of machine learning techniques in interactive learning systems. We identify several dimensions along which interactive learning systems can be analyzed. We argue that while many applications of interactive machines seem different at first sight, sufficient commonalities exist in terms of the challenges faced. By identifying these commonalities between (learning) approaches, and by taking interdisciplinary approaches towards the challenges, we anticipate more effective design and development of sophisticated machines that perceive, act and communicate in complex, dynamic and uncertain environments.

										Dialogue act recognition and simulation are traditionally considered separate processes. Here, we argue that both can be fruitfully treated as interleaved processes within the same probabilistic model, leading to a synchronous improvement of performance in both. To demonstrate this, we train multiple Bayes Nets that predict the timing and content of the next user utterance. A specific focus is on providing support for barge-ins. We describe experiments using the Let’s Go data that show an improvement in classification accuracy (+5%) in Bayesian dialogue act recognition involving barge-ins using partial context compared to using full context. Our results also indicate that simulated dialogues with user barge-in are more realistic than simulations without barge-in events.

										Abstract
									Incremental processing allows system designers to address several discourse phenomena that have previously been somewhat neglected in interactive systems, such as backchannels or barge-ins, but that can enhance the responsiveness and naturalness of systems. Unfortunately, prior work has focused largely on deterministic incremental decision making, rendering system behaviour less flexible and adaptive than is desirable. We present a novel approach to incremental decision making that is based on Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning to achieve an interactive optimisation of Information Presentation (IP) strategies, allowing the system to generate and comprehend backchannels and barge-ins, by employing the recent psycholinguistic hypothesis of information density (ID) (Jaeger, 2010). Results in terms of average rewards and a human rating study show that our learnt strategy outperforms several baselines that are not sensitive to ID by more than 23%.

										Recent studies have shown that incremental systems are perceived as more reactive, natural, and easier to use than non-incremental systems. However, previous work on incremental NLG has not employed recent advances in statistical optimisation using machine learning. This paper combines the two approaches, showing how the update, revoke and purge operations typically used in incremental approaches can be implemented as state transitions in a Markov Decision Process. We design a model of incremental NLG that generates output based on micro-turn interpretations of the user’s utterances and is able to optimise its decisions using statistical machine learning. We present a proof-of-concept study in the domain of Information Presentation (IP), where a learning agent faces the trade-off of whether to present information as soon as it is available (for high reactiveness) or else to wait until input ASR hypotheses are more reliable. Results show that the agent learns to avoid long waiting times, fillers and self-corrections, by re-ordering content based on its confidence.

This problem can be addressed either by using function approximation techniques that estimate an approximate true value function, or by using a hierarchical decomposition of a learning task into subtasks. In this paper, we present a novel approach for dialogue policy optimization that combines the benefits of hierarchical control with function approximation. The approach incorporates two concepts to allow flexible switching between sub-dialogues, extending current hierarchical reinforcement learning methods. First, hierarchical tree-based state representations initially represent a compact portion of the possible state space and are then dynamically extended in real time. Second, we allow state transitions across sub-dialogues to allow non-strict hierarchical control. Our approach is integrated, and tested with real users, in a robot dialogue system that learns to play Quiz games.

							Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems often use a pipeline architecture for sequential decision making. Recent studies however have shown that treating NLG decisions jointly rather than in isolation can improve the overall performance of systems. We present a joint learning framework based on Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) which uses graphical models for surface realisation. Our focus will be on a comparison of Bayesian Networks and HMMs in terms of user satisfaction and naturalness. While the former perform best in isolation, the latter present a scalable alternative within joint systems.

										This paper proposes an approach for learning to coordinate verbal and non-verbal behaviours in interactive robots. It is based on a hierarchy of multiagent reinforcement learners executing verbal and non-verbal actions in parallel. Our approach is evaluated in a conversational humanoid robot that learns to play Quiz games. First experimental results show evidence that the proposed multiagent approach can outperform hand-coded coordinated behaviours.

										Recent work on incremental processing in interactive systems has demonstrated that incremental systems can gain higher responsiveness and naturalness than their non-incremental counter-parts and are better perceived by human users. This paper presents a first investigation, based on a proof-of-concept study, into how multimodal information presentation in incremental dialogue systems can contribute towards more efficient and smooth interactions. In particular, we focus on how a combination of verbal and non-verbal output generation can help to reduce the need for self-corrections in a sys- tem that has to deal with continuous updates of input hypotheses. We suggest to use Reinforcement Learning to optimise the multimodal output allocation of a system, i.e. the idea that for every context, there is a combination of modalities which adequately communicates the communicative goal.

										Intelligent interactive agents that are able to communicate with the world through more than one channel of communication face a number of research questions, for example: how to coordinate them in an effective manner? This is especially important given that perception, action and interaction can often be seen as mutually related disciplines that affect each other.
We believe that machine learning plays and will keep playing an important role in interactive systems. Machine Learning provides an attractive and comprehensive set of computer algorithms for making interactive systems more adaptive to users and the environment and has been a central part of research in the disciplines of interaction, motor control and computer vision in recent years.
This workshop aims to bring researchers together that have an interest in more than one of these disciplines and who have explored frameworks which can offer a more unified perspective on the capabilities of sensing, acting and interacting in intelligent systems and robots.

We motivate the application of online learning, which provides the benefit of improving the system’s behaviour continuously often after each turn or dialogue rather than after hundreds of dialogues. We describe the requirements and advances for dialogue systems with online learning, and speculate on the future of these kinds of systems.

The work presented is part of the FP7 EC Parlance project (http://www.parlance- project.eu). The goal of Parlance is to develop personalised, mobile, interactive, hyper-local search through speech. Recent trends in Information Retrieval are towards incremental, interactive search and we argue that spoken dialogue systems can provide a truly natural medium for this type of interactive search. This is particularly attractive for people on the move, who have their hands and eyes busy.

										This article addresses the problem of scalable optimization for spatially-aware dialogue systems. These kinds of systems must perceive, reason, and act about the spatial environment where they are embedded. We formulate the problem in terms of Semi-Markov Decision Processes and propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach to optimize subbehaviors rather than full behaviors. Because of the vast number of policies that are required to control the interaction in a dynamic environment (e.g., a dialogue system assisting a user to navigate in a building from one location to another), our learning approach is based on two stages: (a) the first stage learns low-level behavior, in advance; and (b) the second stage learns high-level behavior, in real time. For such a purpose we extend an existing algorithm in the literature of reinforcement learning in order to support reusable policies and therefore to perform fast learning. We argue that our learning approach makes the problem feasible, and we report on a novel reinforcement learning dialogue system that performs a joint optimization between dialogue and spatial behaviors. Our experiments, using simulated and real environments, are based on a text-based dialogue system for indoor navigation. Experimental results in a realistic environment reported an overall user satisfaction result of 89%, which suggests that our proposed approach is attractive for its application in real interactions as it combines fast learning with adaptive and reasonable behavior.

										This paper addresses the automatic generation of adaptive and cognitively adequate verbal route descriptions. Current automatic route descriptions suffer from a lack of adaptivity to the principles people employ in wayfinding communication, as well as to particular users’ information needs. We enhance adaptivity and cognitive adequacy by supplementing verbal route descriptions with salient geographic features, applying natural language generation techniques for linguistic realization. We also take users’ familiarity with an area into account. We present an architecture for navigational assistance operating on human cognitive and linguistic principles and report an evaluative user study that confirms the usefulness of our approach.

										Surface realisation decisions in language generation can be sensitive to a language model, but also to decisions of content selection. We therefore propose the joint optimisation of content selection and surface realisation using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). To this end, we suggest a novel reward function that is induced from human data and is especially suited for surface realisation. It is based on a generation space in the form of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Results in terms of task success and human-likeness suggest that our unified approach performs better than greedy or random baselines.

										We present a conversational learning agent that helps users navigate through complex and challenging spatial environments. The agent exhibits adaptive behaviour by learning spatially-aware dialogue actions while the user carries out the navigation task. To this end, we use Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with relational representations to efficiently optimize dialogue actions tightly-coupled with spatial ones, and Bayesian networks to model the user’s beliefs of the navigation environment. Since these beliefs are continuously changing, we induce the agent’s behaviour in real time. Experimental results, using simulation, are encouraging by showing efficient adaptation to the user’s navigation knowledge, specifically to the generated route and the intermediate locations to negotiate with the user.

									Language generators in situated domains face a number of content selection, utterance planning and surface realisation decisions, which can be strictly interdependent. We therefore propose to optimise these processes in a joint fashion using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning. To this end, we induce a reward function for content selection and utterance planning from data using the PARADISE framework, and suggest a novel method for inducing a reward function for surface realisation from corpora. It is based on generation spaces represented as Bayesian Networks. Results in terms of task success and human-likeness suggest that our unified approach performs better than a baseline optimised in isolation or a greedy or random baseline. It receives human ratings close to human authors.

										My research interests involve context-sensitive, or adaptive, Natural Language Generation (NLG) for situated dialogue systems, especially for spoken interaction. Context-sensitive situated dialogue systems are typically required to adapt flexibly to dynamic changes of (a) properties of the situation or the spatial setting, such as visible objects, or the complexity of the environment, (b) properties of the user, such as their prior knowledge, goals, beliefs, and general information need, and (c) the dialogue history. In this context, I am mainly interested in applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) with hierarchical control and prior knowledge in several contexts of rather large-scale systems for complex domains. I have also recently looked into the joint optimisation of different system behaviours for interdependent decision making between them.

									We present a novel approach to natural language generation (NLG) that applies hierarchical reinforcement learning to text generation in the wayfinding domain. Our approach aims to optimise the integration of NLG tasks that are inherently different in nature, such as decisions of content selection, text structure, user modelling, referring expression generation (REG), and surface realisation. It also aims to capture existing interdependencies between these areas. We apply hierarchical reinforcement learning to learn a generation policy that captures these interdependencies, and that can be transferred to other NLG tasks. Our experimental results—in a simulated environment—show that the learnt wayfinding policy outperforms a baseline policy that takes reasonable actions but without optimization.

										When conveying information about spatial situations and goals, speakers adapt flexibly to their addressee in order to reach the communicative goal efficiently and effortlessly. Our aim is to equip a dialogue system with the abilities required for such a natural, adaptive dialogue. In this paper we investigate the strategies people use to convey route information in relation to a map by presenting two parallel studies involving human–human and human–computer interaction. We compare the instructions given to a human interaction partner with those given to a dialogue system which reacts by basic verbal responses and dynamic visualization of the route in the map. The language produced by human route givers is analyzed with respect to a range of communicative as well as cognitively crucial features, particularly perspective choice and references to locations across levels of granularity. Results reveal that speakers produce systematically different instructions with respect to these features, depending on the nature of the interaction partner, human or dialogue system. Our further analysis of clarification and reference resolution strategies produced by human route followers provides insights into dialogue strategies that future systems should be equipped with.

										In this paper we address the assessment of dialogue systems for indoor wayfinding. Based on the PARADISE evaluation framework we propose and evaluate several task success metrics for such a purpose. According to correlation and multiple linear regression analyses, we found that task success metrics that penalise difficulty in wayfinding are more informative of system performance than a success/failure binary task success metric.

										We present a learning approach for efficiently inducing adaptive behaviour of route instructions. For such a purpose we propose a two-stage approach to learn a hierarchy of wayfinding strategies using hierarchical reinforcement learning. Whilst the first stage learns low-level behaviour, the second stage focuses on learning high-level behaviour. In our proposed approach, only the latter is to be applied at runtime in user-machine interactions. Our experiments are based on an indoor navigation scenario for a building that is complex to navigate. We compared our approach with flat reinforcement learning and a fully-learnt hierarchical approach. Our experimental results show that our proposed approach learns significantly faster than the baseline approaches. In addition, the learnt behaviour shows to adapt to the type of user and structure of the spatial environment. This approach is attractive to automatic route giving since it combines fast learning with adaptive behaviour.

					This paper describes the Dublin-Bremen GIVE-2 generation system. Our main approach focused on abstracting over the low-level behaviour of the baseline agent and guide the user by more high-level navigation information. For this purpose, we provided the user with (a) high-level action commands, (b) lookahead information, and (c) a “patience” period after they left the intended path to allow exploration. We describe a number of problems that our system encountered during the evaluation due to some of our initial assumptions not holding, and address several means by which we could achieve better performance in the future.

										We present a dialogue system that automatically generates indoor route instructions in German when asked about locations, using text-based natural language input and output. The challenging task in this system is to provide the user with a compact set of accurate and comprehensible instructions. We describe our approach based on high-level instructions. The system is described with four main modules: natural language understanding, dialogue management, route instruction generation and natural language generation. We report an evaluation with users unfamiliar with the system — using the PARADISE evaluation framework — in a real environment and naturalistic setting. We present results with high user satisfaction, and discuss future directions for enhancing this kind of system with more sophisticated and intuitive interaction.
